###The HTTP Request Lifecycle
This is a pretty broad overview, and it is for a simple HTTP request, not a persistent connection,
but it could act as a good jumping-off point for HTTP and persistent connection requests. 
###Local Processing Depending on how in depth you want to get, much can happen during this step depending 
on the application making the request. 
###Resolve an IP Like the processing done locally, resolving an IP from a "DNS server"2 is a sequence 
that includes many steps, and includes failovers if the first request fails to return an address.
