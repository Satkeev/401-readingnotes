#### Define relationships between objects
Create embedded objects Sometimes, you'd like to express an entity or data object as a cohesive whole in your database 
logic, even if the object contains several fields. 
#Define one-to-one relationships A one-to-one relationship between two entities is a relationship where each instance of
the parent entity corresponds to exactly one instance of the child entity, and vice-versa.
Finally, add a method to the DAO class that returns all instances of the data class that pairs
the parent entity and the child entity. This method requires Room to run two queries, so add
the @Transaction annotation to this method to ensure that the whole operation is performed atomically.
