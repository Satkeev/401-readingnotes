In Android Studio when your app can perform some actions that might be useful from another app,
your app should be prepared to respond to action requests by specifying the appropriate intent
filter in your activity. In cases, when users initiate a "share" action from another app, your
app appears as an option in the chooser dialog. For define which intents your activity can handle, 
each intent filter you add should be as specific as possible in terms of the type of action and
data the activity accepts. A string naming the action to perform. Usually one of the platform-defined
values such as ACTION_SEND or ACTION_VIEW. We can specify this in your intent filter with the <data> element.
Provides an additional way to characterize the activity handling the intent, usually related to the user
gesture or location from which it's started. There are several different categories supported by the system,
but most are rarely used. Then, in order to decide what action to take in your activity, you can read the 
Intent was used to start it. Finally, If you want to return a result to the activity that invoked yours, 
simply call setResults() to specify the result code and result Intent.
