####Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application
We will build a server that accepts a message that carries a userâ€™s name. In response, the server will push
a greeting into a queue to which the client is subscribed.
Then we can start from scratch and complete each step or you can bypass
basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.
To start from scratch, move on to Starting with Spring Initializr.
When you finish, you can check your results against the code in gs-messaging-stomp-websocket/complete.
Starting with Spring Initializr For all Spring applications, you should start with the Spring Initializr. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all 
the dependencies you need for an application and does a lot of the set up for you.
