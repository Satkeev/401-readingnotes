#### Integration testing plays an important role in the application development
cycle by verifying the end-to-end behavior of a system.
Enable Spring in Tests First, any Spring enabled test will run with the help
of @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class); the runner
is essentially the entry-point to start using the Spring Test framework. We also need
the @ContextConfiguration annotations to load the context configuration and bootstrap 
the context that the test will use.
