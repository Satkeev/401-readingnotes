#### Customize your RecyclerView
We can customize the RecyclerView objects to meet our specific needs. 
#Modifying the layout The RecyclerView uses a layout manager to position the individual
items on the screen and determine when to reuse item views that are no longer visible to the user. 
#LinearLayoutManager arranges the items in a one-dimensional list. Using a RecyclerView with LinearLayoutManager provides
functionality like the older ListView layout.
#Add item animations The RecyclerView uses an animator to change its appearance. This animator is an
object that extends the abstract RecyclerView.
# Enable list-item selection RecyclerView list using touch or mouse input.
