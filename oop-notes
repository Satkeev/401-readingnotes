Java uses object-oriented technology, real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, 
your bicycle. Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. 
These real-world observations all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Java  represent the object's state, and the methods define its
interaction with the outside world.
