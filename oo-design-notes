SOLID principles, particularly if you program in object oriented languages.
The single responsibility principle (SRP) asserts that a class or module should do one thing only.
O is for Open/Closed Principle
The Open/Closed Principle states that code entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L is for Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is the one here that is most unique to object-oriented programming. 
The LSP says, basically, that any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent
without things blowing up.
