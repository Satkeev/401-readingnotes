#### Espresso In Android Studio  Espresso uses for write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.
Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of
boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.
Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls 
behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.
Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part
of the development lifecycle. While it can be used for black-box testing, Espressoâ€™s full
power is unlocked by those who are familiar with the codebase under test.
