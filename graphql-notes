#### API (GRAPHQL) The @connection directive enables you to specify relationships between @model types. Its 
supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships. You may implement many-to-many 
relationships using two one-to-many connections and a joining @model type.
The keyName argument can optionally be used to specify the name of secondary index (an index that was set
up using @key) that should be queried from the other type in the relationship.
When specifying a keyName, the fields argument should be provided to indicate which field(s) will be 
used to get connected objects. If keyName is not provided, then @connection queries the target tableâ€™s primary index.
